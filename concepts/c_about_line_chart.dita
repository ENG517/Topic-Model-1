    <title>Line Chart</title>
    <conbody>
        <p>A line chart is a data visualization tool in which data points are connected by a line to illustrate trends, changes, or relationships over time or between two variables. Pythonâ€™s Matplotlib library provides an accessible way to create line charts, ideal for technical and analytical tasks.</p>

        <section>
            <title>Purpose of Line Charts</title>
            <p>Line charts are particularly useful for visualizing trends over intervals, such as time series data or the relationship between two datasets. They help in identifying patterns, making comparisons, and displaying changes in data values effectively.</p>

            <title>Setting Up the Environment</title>
            <p>Creating a line chart with Matplotlib requires importing the <ph>matplotlib.pyplot</ph> module in Python. This module offers various plotting functions that support a wide range of visualization types, including line charts.</p>

            <title>Data Structure for Line Charts</title>
            <p>A line chart requires two lists or arrays: one representing the x-axis (horizontal values) and the other the y-axis (vertical values). Each pair of x and y values forms a point on the chart, and consecutive points are connected by a line to show the data's progression.</p>

            <title>Displaying the Line Chart</title>
            <p>Once the data is plotted, using <ph>plt.show()</ph> renders the chart, making it visible on your computer screen. The output chart visually represents the relationship between the chosen x and y values, helping to interpret the dataset.</p>

            <title>Example Visualization</title>
            <p>Running the complete code produces a graphical representation of the data. The displayed line chart allows you to observe and analyze the plotted trend or data behavior effectively.</p>
