    <title>Line Chart Type</title>
    <!-- shortdesc? Also, is this pretty much the same as the "about line charts" file? -->
    <conbody>
        <p>A line chart is a type of data visualization that displays data points connected by straight line segments, useful for showing trends over time or the relationship between two variables. This concept provides an overview of creating a line chart using Python and the Matplotlib library.</p>

            <title>Importing Matplotlib</title>
            <p>To create a line chart, first import the <ph>matplotlib.pyplot</ph> library into your Python environment. This module provides functions specifically for plotting data.</p>

            <title>Preparing Data for the Line Chart</title>
            <p>Data points for a line chart are typically represented as two lists: one for the x-axis values and one for the y-axis values. Each list represents a series of values that will be connected on the chart, visually displaying the data's trend.</p>

            <title>Creating and Displaying the Line Chart</title>
            <p>Using the <ph>plot()</ph> function in Matplotlib, a line chart can be generated by plotting the prepared x and y values. To display the plot, the <ph>plt.show()</ph> function is used, allowing the figure to render on your screen.</p>

            <title>Example Output</title>
            <p>When the code is executed, the final plot will display as a visual representation of the data. The line chart provides a straightforward way to analyze patterns or changes across the dataset.</p>
