## Introduction
This report summarizes the significant edits and redesigns made to our DITA topic model, focusing on plain-language principles, improved typography, and accessible document design. Incorporating our professor's feedback and aligning with Team 1's style guide, we enhanced clarity, consistency, and usability across the documentation.

## Key Edits and Revisions

### 1. **Macro-Level Content Organization**
- **What we did**: Reorganized sections for a logical and consistent flow. Grouped tasks and references under appropriate headings for better navigation.
- **Example**: Split broader "Matplotlib Overview" content into focused topics like "Installing Matplotlib" and "Line Chart Examples" to avoid redundancy and improve reusability.
  - **File Reference**: [concept.dtd (Line Chart Overview)](https://github.com/ENG517/Topic-Model-1/blob/main/out/bar-chart-plain-language.pdf)
  - **Before**: Combined installation and overview in one topic.
  - **After**: Distinct sections for installation, usage examples, and conceptual details.

### 2. **Micro-Level Edits**
- **Tasks Simplified**: Revised restrictive references to support reusability.
  - **Example**: Changed "to create this chart, follow these steps" to "create bar charts using these steps."  
- **Consistent Terminology**: Unified "Python IDE" across topics, replacing variations like "your editor" or "the environment."
- **Active Voice**: Replaced passive phrases like "plots can be created" with "create plots."

### 3. **Document Design Enhancements**
- **Typography and Line Spacing**: Adopted fonts and sizes from the style guide.
  - **Headings**: Used Merriweather Black for H1 and Open Sans for body text, ensuring contrast and readability.
  - **Spacing**: Adjusted line spacing to improve visual clarity (e.g., H1: 24pt, Body: 12pt).
  - **Design Results**: Below are the comparisons of old and new typography styles.

  Here is the old typography design:

## Conclusion
Our edits improved the DITA topic model's accessibility, usability, and overall alignment with plain-language principles. Through thoughtful organization, consistent terminology, and better design, the documentation now supports a wider audience, including beginners and advanced users of Matplotlib.
